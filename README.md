# Fantasy Sports Algorithm #

This is a small application to help you select players for fantasy sports teams. 
First up is fantasy football. Below I will detail what is needed to use this 
tool, what assumptions are made, and how the selection process works.

## Author's Notes ##

#Incomplete Tasks #
* Player() connect to database to build real players
* Team() view available players and stats. (Maybe return from player_repo)
* Team() select specific player for draft.
* for each team in Draft.draft() re-do if selection is invalid
* Team() rate the available players



Below are just a few things I have left here so I know what needs to be done. 

* Source for rules and data points
	- Use the following links to find out how to rate players for your team
	and to get corresponding data points
		- Scoring settings - http://www.nfl.com/fantasyfootball/help/nfl-scoringsettings#settings
		- NFL stats by player position - http://www.nfl.com/stats/categorystats?tabSeq=1&statisticPositionCategory=QUARTERBACK&qualified=true&season=2010&seasonType=REG
		- better stats by player position - http://fantasy.nfl.com/research/players
		- list of all players - http://www.nfl.com/players/search

* Further steps
	- is there a way to get game stats for more data points?
