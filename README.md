# Fantasy Sports Algorithm #

This is a small application to help you select players for fantasy sports teams.

FirstDraft was my first foray into Test Driven Development (TDD).
Please check out my file "journal.md" to hear my thoughts on how it went!

### How do I get set up? ###
This project is pure python 3. No additional packages needed.

#Incomplete Tasks #
Below are few things I need to build or clean up in the project.

* ~~User interface: allow Team to pick() players from list~~
* Better error-handling for invalid user inputs
* UI: for each team in Draft.draft() re-do if selection is invalid
* ~~AI: automated strategy option for team~~
* UI: remove players without them being drafted (for real-life simulation)
* ~~PlayerRepo() or Team() add standard deviation for positions.~~
* ~~Player() connect to database to build real players~~
* ~~Team() view available players and stats. (Maybe return from player_repo)~~ 

* Source for rules and data points
	- Use the following links to find out how to rate players for your team
	and to get corresponding data points
		- Scoring settings - http://www.nfl.com/fantasyfootball/help/nfl-scoringsettings#settings
		- NFL stats by player position - http://www.nfl.com/stats/categorystats?tabSeq=1&statisticPositionCategory=QUARTERBACK&qualified=true&season=2010&seasonType=REG
		- better stats by player position - http://fantasy.nfl.com/research/players
		- list of all players - http://www.nfl.com/players/search

* Further steps
	- is there a way to get game stats for more data points?
